# task-scheduling-kernel

I'm building an advanced task management utility because I'm done with Google Taskboard. This project is going to give me the chance to practice both front-end and back-end development. For back-end, I will have to work on user authentication, database storage, and hosting the application. On the flipside, I am going to have to create an intuitive but powerful UI that allows users to access all of the feautures quickly and easily. Some of these features will include:

- editable hotkeys
- different views
- various sorting methods
- tags
- app themes
- email/push notifications

Depending on how this turns out, I would also like to create an iOS app, as I would like to become familiar with Swift.
